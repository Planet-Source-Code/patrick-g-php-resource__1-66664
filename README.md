### Description

This is a program i originally started about 3 months ago and have been side tracked and lost interest for awhile to continue.

If i believe this could become a useful program and learning tool i'll gladly continue it.

The purpose of the program is to carry a database of 1000's of php sniplets (as i am a php programmer) to assist yourself for future use.

Also the idea was to simplify PHP for new programmers looking for a specific function, sniplet etc.

Let me know
